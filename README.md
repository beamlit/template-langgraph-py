## ‚ú® Features

- Interactive conversational interface
- Tool integration support (including weather and search capabilities)
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Built on LangGraph for efficient agent orchestration
- Easy deployment and integration with Blaxel platform

## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-langgraph-py.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-langgraph-py

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the server
bl serve --hotreload

# In another terminal, test the agent
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
  ```
- **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
  ```bash
  bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
  ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-langgraph-py.git
cd template-langgraph-py
uv sync
```

## üîß Usage

### Running the Server Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

_Note:_ This command starts the server and enables hot reload so that changes to the source code are automatically reflected.

### Testing your agent

You can test your agent using the chat interface:

```bash
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

Or run it directly with specific input:

```bash
bl run agent blaxel-agent --local --data '{"input": "What is the weather in Paris?"}'
```

### Deploying to Blaxel

When you are ready to deploy your application:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your application.

## üìö API Reference

The LangGraph agent exposes the following endpoints:

- **POST /agents/{agent_id}/run**: Run the agent with provided input
  ```json
  {
    "input": "What is the weather in Paris?",
    "stream": true
  }
  ```

- **GET /agents/{agent_id}/info**: Get information about the agent capabilities
- **GET /health**: Health check endpoint

For detailed API documentation, run the server and visit `/docs` endpoint.
