## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-langgraph-py.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-langgraph-py

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the server
bl serve --hotreload

# In another terminal, test the agent
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
    ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-langgraph-py.git
cd template-langgraph-py
uv sync
```

## üîß Usage

### Running the Server Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

_Note:_ This command starts the server and enables hot reload so that changes to the source code are automatically reflected.

### Testing your agent

You can test your agent using the chat interface:

```bash
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

Or run it directly with specific input:

```bash
bl run agent blaxel-agent --local --data '{"input": "What is the weather in Paris?"}'
```

### Deploying to Blaxel

When you are ready to deploy your application:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your application.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blaxel Platform Issues**:
   - Ensure you're logged in to your workspace: `bl login MY-WORKSPACE`
   - Verify models are available: `bl get models`
   - Check that functions exist: `bl get functions`

2. **Tool Integration Failures**:
   - Ensure tool functions are properly registered in LangGraph
   - Check tool parameter validation through Blaxel platform
   - Verify tool execution permissions and access
   - Review tool response formats and error handling

3. **Dependency and Environment Issues**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.10+
   - Try `uv sync --upgrade` to update dependencies
   - Check for conflicting package versions
   - Verify virtual environment activation
